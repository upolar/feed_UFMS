## About this project

A initial project to practice webscraping with python on the college website. The project extract the news and post it on a Telegram Channel. 


### First steps

To the bot be able to realize a post you should edit two variables `BOT_TOKEN` and `CHANNEL_ID` that are in `credentials.py` file. Even without these credentials the script will be able to get the news from the website.

| variable | Description |
| ---  | --- |
| `BOT_TOKEN` | To get a bot token, create a bot in [@botfather](https://t.me/botfather)|
| `CHANNEL_ID` | The channel identifier ("@username" or ID) where the bot will post the news if it has enough permissions |
